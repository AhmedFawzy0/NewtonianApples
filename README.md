# Physics Simulations for Quality Education

Welcome to our Physics Simulations project, aimed at providing accessible and engaging physics learning experiences for those who may not have access to traditional high-quality education, especially in the aftermath of pandemic-related disruptions. Our platform offers a set of interactive modules designed to recreate the magic of physics labs, fostering a deep understanding of fundamental concepts.

## Key Features:

- **Collisions Module:** Explore the principles of momentum, conservation of energy, and elastic and inelastic collisions through real-time simulations.
- **Dynamics Module:** Dive into the world of forces, acceleration, and Newton's laws by experimenting with dynamic scenarios and studying the effects of external factors.
- **Kinematics Module:** Unravel the mysteries of motion, acceleration, velocity, and displacement using our interactive simulations.

Our mission is to make physics engaging and accessible for all, allowing learners to experiment, observe, and learn in a fun and interactive way. Whether you're a student looking to supplement your education or an enthusiast seeking to explore the wonders of the physical world, our platform is your gateway to the fascinating realm of physics. Happy learning!
